## Description

Welcome to Work Scheduler!

At the top of the page you will see today's date and the current time.

Here you will be able to add tasks that you need to do during your work day.

Each hour has its own description bar that is color cordinated for the time of the day. Grey if it has past that time, red for current hour, and green for the future.

Each description box has a save button at the end that allows you to save whatever task you have entered in.

If you refresh the page your tasks will also be there too!
